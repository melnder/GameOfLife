# Conway's Game of Life

A Three.js implementation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton.

## Game Rules

Conway's Game of Life follows these simple rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.

## Controls

- Left-click and drag: Draw or erase initial living cells
- Start/Pause(Space): Toggle the simulation
- Reset(Esc): Clear the grid
